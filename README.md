Other than HTML and CSS, I wanted to develop the whole thing using TypeScript. I'm most definitely not over-engineering this thing just because I can.

## Frontend
### Stack
- React
- Tailwind
- Redux ~~(Soon)~~
- Jest ~~(Soon ~too~)~~
- Vite
### Testing
Run `npm run test`. Jest will show the results of the tests.
### Build
Run `npm run build`. The bundled files will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
### Development server
Run `npm run dev`. Navigate to `http://localhost:5173/`. Vite's HRM API will help showing changes to the app without reloading it 

## Backend
### Stack
- Express
### Testing

### Build
Run `npm run build`. The transpiled files will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
### Development server
Run `npm run dev`.
